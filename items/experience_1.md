### Being an Executive for the SOAR Conference

1) What was it that you did?

- Picked the conference's theme
- Designed the conference's logo
- Painted a banner for the entrance of the conference

2) When did you do it?

I was the Creative Director of Turner Fenton's SOAR for both the 2018 and 2019 conferences

3) What was good about it?

- I was able to stretch my desig skills to create actual tangible products (ie. the logo was printed on shirts and other merch)
- Painting the banner help to apply my painting skills for a new pplication

4) What was your favourite memory of it?

- I particularily enjoyed painting the banner. The banner was so long that it was virtually impossible to find a place to lay it out so I could paint. I ended up having to completely rearrange a part of my house and lay down newspaper along all of the floor to be able to paint.
