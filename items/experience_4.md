### Releasing My First Song Cover

1) What was it that you did?

- I recorded a song cover with my friend
- I drew all of the art for the music video

2) When did you do it?

- I did this quite recently, the video was released on September 24, 2023

3) What was good about it?

- I was able to use a skill I had never really explored before
- I had a new application for my art skills that was very fun to draw for

4) What was your favourite memory of it?

<p>The best part of the experience was during the premiere of the final video. I was in a call with all of my friends who were watching the result live with me. Seeing everyone's reactions in real time was amazing to experience!</p>

5) What didn't you enjoy about it?

<p>Unfortunately as I am not the best singer it was very difficult for me to hit some of the notes. This was especially difficult as I was recording during orientation week and would often go home after yelling all day. Despite this I gave my best effort and am proud of the results!</p>
